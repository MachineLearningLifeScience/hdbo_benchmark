      <description>Abstract&#xA;Optimizing discrete black-box functions is key in several domains, e.g. protein engineering and drug design. Due to the lack of gradient information and the need for sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization is an ideal candidate for these tasks.</description>

      <description>Conclusion &amp;nbsp; In this paper, we surveyed the field of high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HDBO) focusing on discrete problems. This highlighted the need for (i) a novel taxonomy of the field that emphasizes the differences between methods that rely on unsupervised discrete information, and methods that optimize sequences directly, and (ii) a standardized framework for benchmarking these methods.</description>

      <description>Preliminaries &amp;nbsp; Bayesian Optimization and Gaussian processes &amp;nbsp; Bayesian optimization requires a surrogate model and an acquisition function [@Garnett:BOBook:2023]. Given both, the objective function is sequentially optimized by fitting a model to the given observations and numerically optimizing the acquisition function with respect to the model to select the next configuration for evaluation.</description>

      <description>A taxonomy of high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization &amp;nbsp; We describe the field of high dimensional BO and the large number of related publications through a refined taxonomy building on previous work, discussing variable selection, additive models, trust regions, linear embeddings, non-linear embeddings, gradient information, structured spaces, and others in turn.</description>

      <description>We test several HDBO methods on discrete sequence optimization tasks. So far, we have optimized the PMO benchmark on SELFIES representations, and also thermal stability of red fluorescent proteins and their mutations using RaSP.</description>
